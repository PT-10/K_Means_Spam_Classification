Data Loading and Pre-processing:</br>
We first load the data from the CSV file and perform the necessary pre-processing steps, including dropping null comments and irrelevant columns, cleaning the comments data using NLTK, and converting the categorical data to numerical data using label encoding. The final pre-processed dataset consists of the "User", "Video Title", and "Comment Actual" columns.
